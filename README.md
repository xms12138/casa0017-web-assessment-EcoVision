## Project Overview  

**EcoVision** is an interactive website created to visualise how **vehicle emissions** and **traffic levels** impact **air quality across London’s 33 boroughs**.  
Our goal is to make environmental data more accessible and help the public understand how **daily travel choices** affect pollution levels in their local area.

Through our dynamic map, users can:  
- View **hourly changes in air quality** (CO₂ / NO₂) alongside **traffic density** over a 24-hour period.  
- Click on each borough to reveal its air-quality index, traffic data, and insights.  
- Explore a **cycling-vs-car comparison** tool showing journey-time differences for short distances, promoting greener travel.  

EcoVision transforms complex datasets into a **clear, interactive experience**, encouraging people to make **informed decisions** about mobility and sustainability.

## Research Context  

Air pollution is one of London’s most critical environmental and public-health issues.  
Although open data sources provide valuable insights, they are often buried in static reports that are difficult for the public to interpret.

**EcoVision bridges this gap** by combining open-source data with visual storytelling, turning numbers into an interactive, time-based urban narrative.

### Data Sources  
- **Transport for London (TfL)** – Traffic and congestion data  
- **London Air Quality Network (LAQN)** – Air pollution datasets  
- **Greater London Authority (GLA)** – Borough boundaries and statistics  
- **Centre for London** – Environmental and policy research reports  

This project aligns with the **UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDG 11 – Sustainable Cities and Communities)**.
