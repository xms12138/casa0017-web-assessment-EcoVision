## 🌱 Who We Are  

**EcoVision** is a collaborative student team from the **Centre for Advanced Spatial Analysis (CASA)** at **University College London**.  
Our mission is to **translate complex environmental data into clear, engaging, and interactive web experiences** that inspire people to understand and act on sustainability challenges.  

We combine **data, design, and digital storytelling** to reveal the invisible patterns shaping our cities — from emissions and mobility to air quality and green space.

## 💡 What We Do  

Our flagship project, **EcoVision Team**, visualises how **vehicle emissions**, **traffic flow**, and **air quality** interact across **London’s 33 boroughs**.  

Through our interactive website, users can:  
- View **hourly changes in CO₂ and NO₂ emissions** alongside traffic levels.  
- Explore **borough-specific insights** and sustainability tips.  
- Compare **cycling vs car journey times** to promote greener travel.  

By transforming open datasets into interactive maps and data stories, **EcoVision helps Londoners make informed decisions** for a cleaner, more sustainable future.
