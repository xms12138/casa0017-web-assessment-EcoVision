## 🌍 Project Overview  

**EcoVision** is an interactive data-driven platform that visualises **London’s air quality and traffic emissions** in real time across all **33 boroughs**.  
Our goal is to help Londoners **understand how traffic affects air pollution** and encourage **sustainable travel choices**.  

The website enables users to:  
✅ Explore **hourly pollution changes** throughout a 24-hour period  
✅ View **borough-specific CO₂/NO₂ levels** alongside traffic density  
✅ Compare **cycling vs car travel times** for short trips  
✅ Discover how behaviour change can improve urban air quality  

EcoVision transforms open data into a **simple, intuitive visual story**, showing that small daily choices can contribute to a cleaner, healthier London.

## 🧭 Research Context  

Air pollution remains a leading environmental challenge in London, impacting public health, biodiversity, and climate.  
While open datasets exist, they are often presented in static formats that are difficult for everyday citizens to interpret.  

EcoVision bridges this gap through **interactive storytelling**, combining spatial data, time-based visualisation, and actionable insights.  

### 📚 Key Data Sources  
- **Transport for London (TfL)** – Traffic flow and congestion data  
- **London Air Quality Network (LAQN)** – Hourly pollutant concentrations  
- **Centre for London** – Sustainability research and urban insights  
- **Greater London Authority (GLA)** – Borough boundaries and statistics  

This project supports **UN Sustainable Development Goal 11 – Sustainable Cities and Communities**.
